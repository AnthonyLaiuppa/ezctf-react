### EZCTF - React
---

This is the front-end written to accompany the Golang api portion of the EZCTF - Webapp.

A continuation of [my EZCTF app from last year.](https://github.com/AnthonyLaiuppa/ezctf) 

I'm not really big into front-end development so we're using Bootstrap 4 to keep it simple here.


##### Dependencies

Requires following dependencies:

* react-router-dom
* react-bootstrap
* bootstrap

##### `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
